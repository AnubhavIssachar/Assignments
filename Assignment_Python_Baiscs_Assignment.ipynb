        "Ans. Key features of python that makes it so popular among programmers community aew as follows:-\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Readibility- Clean and straightforward syntax that enhances simplicity and readibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Flexibility- Python can deal with procedural, object oriented and functional programming that makes it flexible enough for progrfammers to choose best approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Rich standard Libraries-a) Includes modules and packages for various tasks like:\n",
        "a.1- File handling\n",
        "a.2- Web development\n",
        "a.3- Data manipulation\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Lots of third party libraries and FrAMEWORK like numpy,pandas,Django,Flask etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Multiplatform compatibility on Windows, MacOS, Linux allows programmers to work in diverse environments\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Integration capabilities- Python can easily  integrate with other languages like  c++ and java making it suitable for large range of applications\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Strong data science and Machine Learning libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn etc.\n",
